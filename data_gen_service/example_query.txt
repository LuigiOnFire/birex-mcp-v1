# Run the following command to execute a SQL script as the 'postgres' user:
psql -U postgres -d anomaly_data -f 02_gen_fake_data_anomaly.sql

# NOTE: This must be run outside of any Python virtual environment (venv),
# as some environments may interfere with PATH or Postgres authentication.

# To create a new database, you need to log in to the terminal with
psql -U postgres

# (The credentials have already been handled)
# Then, in the psql terminal, write
CREATE_DATABASE <database_name>
